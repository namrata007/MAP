Aim:
    To run Gblocks for the input sequences and obtain a trimmed alignment.
    
Input:
1. The given input alignment sequences in .msl format.
2. A batch file code that reads the input alignment sequences from all the six specified input folders and run the Gblocks command.

Idea:
1. Receive the input files sequentially using batch file code.
2. Run the Gblocks command to trim the input alignments and save the trimmed outputs in specified output folders.
3. Trimmed alignments are saved with '.txt' extension and subsequently used for tree generation.

Steps:
1. Gblocks software package was downloaded and the source code was compiled in myhome directory (Path:'/myhome/project/Gblocks_0.91b/Gblocks'). Gblocks was then run      from this specified path. A copy of the test files from MAP/data/appbio11 was also saved in this specified folder. 
2. The python code 'gblocks.py' was run on the test files in the above specified path to obtain the trimmed output. 

Parameters used:
 1. -t=p : Indicating the alignment file is of type Protein sequences
 2. -p=n : Parameter files and results in HTML format are not saved ( to save disk space)
 3. -e=  : Extension for output files was taken as an input argument from user. In this case, we specified it as '.txt'


Output:
       Output folders with each input alignment trimmed using Gblocks was obtained.

Future work:
       To obtain phylogenetic trees based on both data files obtained from Gblocks and TrimAl.
