Aim:

    To read multiple files from a folder, process them to reduce noise based on 3 conditions.
    Column is considered noisy if
	 1) there are more than 50% indels,
	 2) at least 50% of amino acids are unique,
	 3) no amino acid appears more than twice.
	

Input:

    Path to the folder where files are present, extension of files to be read, folder where processed files are to be stored

Algorithm:

Step 1: Call batchfile function with arguments as the folder path and extension of file to be read as batchfile(inputdirectory, extension))
It reads all files and appends them to a list Total_files.

Step 2: Call readfile function with arguments as input directory and Total files to be read as readfile(inputdirectory,Total_files). It reads each file one by one.

Step 3: In readfile funtion, call processing function with sequences and total columns in each file as processing(seqs, num_col). It returns sequences with reduced noise 

Step 4: In processing funtion, call delete function with check for 3 conditions and column that is found noisy as delete(noisy2, noisy3, seqs, col). It deletes noisy column. Here noisy2 condition includes both condition 1 and 2 check and noisy3 is for condition 3. 

Step 5: In readfile funtion, call writing function with reduced noise sequence ,sequence description ,sequence id and file name as writing(seqs,seq_descs,seq_ids,Total_files[i]). It writes the reduced noise sequence in a new file with the same name and an extension as .output. 
 

Output:

       All new files with reduced noise are stored in specified folder

Future work:

       Generate a tree from the reduced noise MSA files
