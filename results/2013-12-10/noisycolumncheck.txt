Aim:
    A part of our algorithm for checking noisy columns was created based on the second criteria. In this case, we consider a column as noisy if it contains atleast    fifty percent of unique amino acids.
    
Input:
      As of now for startup, we read one alignment file at a time in this program and check the criteria of noisiness for each column.

Idea:
1. Receive the file as a command line input argument
2. Parse the file using Biopython and store the accesion ids and alignments in seperate lists
3. Obtain the total number of columns in the alignment
4. For each column check if it is noisy [Column is noisy if (types of unique amino acids present in the column)>=(total no. of amino acids in the column)]

Output:
       Print a result list indicating the noisy columns as 1 and non noisy columns as 0.
       Also print the total no. of sequences present in the alignment, total no. of columns, total no. of noisy and non noisy columns respectively for clarity.

Future work:
       The code must be improved to accept multiple alignment files as input
       The noisy columns detected in this algorithm must be removed
