Aim:
    Third condition for noisy columns is no amino acid appears more than twice. 
Input:
      A single msl file with multiple alignments.

Algorithm:
Step 1: Read sequences in msl file using biopython module
Step 2: Store sequences and ids separately for each sequence
Step 3: Calculate total number of alignments or sequences 
Step 4: Loop over alignments to check each column amino acids 
Step 5: If no amino acid appears more than twice in a column, it is considered noisy

Output:
       Columns that are noisy in the msl file
Future work:
       To work with batch files
       Remove noisy columns
       Develop trees for the new alignment
