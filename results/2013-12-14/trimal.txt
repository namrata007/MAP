Prepared by Shalini:

Aim:
    To run trimAl for the input sequences and obtain a trimmed alignment based on an automated trimAl algorithm.
    
Input:
      A batch file code that reads the input alignment sequences from all the six specified input folders and run the trimAl command.

Idea:
1. Receive the input files sequentially using batch file code.
2. Run the trimAl command to trim the input alignments based on "automated1" algorithm and save the trimmed outputs in specified output folders.
3. Run the trimAl command with the same "automated1" algorithm and to save a few results in HTML format.
4. Use the HTML format for viewing of trimmed alignments.

Output:
       Output folders with each input alignment trimmed using trimAl was obtained.

Future work:
       To apply the same idea for trimming noisy columns using Gblocks.
